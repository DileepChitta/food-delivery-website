# FoodieApp üçî

FoodieApp is a full-stack food delivery application that allows users to browse menus, add items to their cart, and place orders for delivery. The project is organized into three main parts: `client` (React frontend), `server` (Node.js/Express backend), and `service` (alternative backend implementation).

## Features

- User registration and login
- Browse food menu and view item details
- Add items to cart and manage cart contents
- Checkout and place orders
- Order confirmation via email (EmailJS/Nodemailer)
- Responsive design with Bootstrap
- EJS templating for server-rendered pages

## Project Structure

### `client/`

- Built with React and Vite
- Contains pages for Home, Menu, Cart, Checkout, and Login
- Uses React Router for navigation
- Bootstrap for styling

### `server/`

- Express.js backend (ES modules)
- MongoDB via Mongoose for data storage
- Routes for authentication, menu, cart, checkout, and orders
- EJS templates for server-side rendering
- Nodemailer for sending order confirmation emails

### `service/`

- Alternative Express.js backend (CommonJS)
- Similar features and structure to `server/`
- EJS templates and MongoDB integration
